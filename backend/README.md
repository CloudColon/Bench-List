# Employee Management System - Backend

This is the backend API for the Employee Management System that allows companies to register their bench employees and other companies to request and view this data.

## Features

- **Custom User Authentication**: Email and password-based authentication using JWT tokens
- **Role-based Access Control**: Admin and Company User roles
- **Company Management**: Create and manage company profiles
- **Employee Management**: Register and track bench employees with detailed information
- **Bench Request System**: Request employees from other companies
- **RESTful API**: Comprehensive API endpoints for all operations
- **Swagger/OpenAPI Documentation**: Interactive API testing interface

## Technology Stack

- Django 5.2.7
- Django REST Framework
- JWT Authentication (djangorestframework-simplejwt)
- Swagger/OpenAPI (drf-yasg)
- **PostgreSQL** (recommended) or SQLite for development
- Python 3.14
- Environment-based configuration with python-decouple

## Database Options

### PostgreSQL (Recommended for Production)
âœ… Configured and ready to use!
- Better performance for concurrent access
- Production-ready
- Full-text search capabilities
- See **[POSTGRESQL_SETUP.md](POSTGRESQL_SETUP.md)** for setup instructions

### SQLite (Development)
- Quick setup for testing
- No additional installation needed
- Switch between databases using `.env` file

**Quick Setup:** See [POSTGRESQL_QUICKSTART.md](POSTGRESQL_QUICKSTART.md) for 3-step PostgreSQL setup!

## Quick Start

### Access Interactive API Documentation
Once the server is running, visit:
- **Swagger UI**: http://localhost:8000/swagger/
- **ReDoc**: http://localhost:8000/redoc/
- **Admin Panel**: http://localhost:8000/admin/

See [SWAGGER_GUIDE.md](SWAGGER_GUIDE.md) for detailed usage instructions.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update with your settings:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` file:
```env
USE_POSTGRES=True  # Set to False to use SQLite
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
```

### 3. Set Up PostgreSQL (Optional but Recommended)

See [POSTGRESQL_QUICKSTART.md](POSTGRESQL_QUICKSTART.md) or [POSTGRESQL_SETUP.md](POSTGRESQL_SETUP.md) for detailed instructions.

### 4. Run Migrations

Run migrations to set up the database:

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### 5. Create Superuser

### 5. Create Superuser

Create an admin user to access the Django admin panel:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

### 6. Run Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000/`

## Authentication

All API endpoints (except registration and login) require JWT authentication. Include the token in the Authorization header:

Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>
```

## Admin Panel

Access the Django admin panel at `http://localhost:8000/admin/` to manage all models through a web interface.

## Development Notes

- CORS is configured for localhost:3000 and localhost:8000
- Media files (employee resumes) are stored in the `media/` directory
- The system uses SQLite by default; update `settings.py` for production databases
- JWT tokens expire after 1 hour; refresh tokens are valid for 7 days
